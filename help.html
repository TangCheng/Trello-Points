	<h2>Trello Points Chrome Extension Help</h2>
	<p>Trello Points is a Chrome Extension that adds a notion of points
		to the card of a Trello board. Each lists display the total points of
		his cards. In the continuity of Trello.com, you are free to add any
		meanings to the points of card. It can be:
	<ul>
		<li>the story points in a scrum board</li>
		<li>days to complete the task in a todo list board</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ul>
	As Trello's board are used for many unuspected things, Trello Points
	can help you to add another criteria to the card (label, members, votes
	due date, check list are already provided by Trello).
	</p>
	<h3>Adding points to a card</h3>
	<p>
		Points are written in between parentheses at the end of the title of a
		card.
		<code>upon an error I want to see an awesome 404 page. (5)</code>
		Upon saving the card, Trello Points picks up the assigned points and
		shows them as a badge in the lower left corner of the card.
	</p>
	<p>When you flip a card to add more information to that card, you
		are also presented with a point picker upon editing the title. This
		allows for easier entry. You can configure wich sequence to use in the
		point picker in the options of the extension. The commonly used
		semi-fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20 is used per default.
	</p>
	<p>Allowed entries for points are all numbers, decimals (like .5 or
		4.2) and the question mark (?) for unknowns. Negative points are not
		(yet) supported...</p>
	<h3>Filtering cards</h3>
	<p>When you activate some filters (labels, authors...) the total score of each list
	is updated to take into account only visible cards.
	
	You also have the options to display others scores : total filtered vs. total, percentage..
	just go to the <b>options</b> of the extension.
